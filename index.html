                <h2>Introduction to HSD</h2>
                <p>When we first learnt about HSD, it was a foreign concept. We had started with Causal Loop Diagrams and I found it quite intriguing how a simple diagram could accurately represent the qualitative effect that factors have on a system.</p>

                <h2>Learning about Level Rate Diagrams</h2>
                <p>LRDs demonstrate how levels quantitatively influence rates over a period of time. While I did not struggle with the Maths aspects (because I did it in school), I did struggle to find the relevance of it to the course because we often used examples of water in a bathtub or people in a population which have nothing to do with medicine. This made it confusing for me to link HSD to public health and the other disciplines that form this course.</p>

                <h2>Integration of LRDs</h2>
                <p>In our tutorial (W4S4), we did an activity on epidemic modelling. LRDs can be used in epidemic modeling to visually represent the progression of a disease and the rates at which individuals are susceptible, infected and recovered. This helpsed me to understand the dynamics of disease spread which could strengthen my knowledge on the impact of interventions which would link with the public health intiatives that we learn about in other aspects of the course.</p>

                <h2>Integration of CLDs</h2>
                <p>We did a class with Dr Roes in Week 6 where we needed to draw a CLD about how the WHO building block of health workforce affected healthcare delivery. This helped me to see how CLDs could effectively be integrated into this course. It also strengthened my understanding of the fact that all the building blocks are intrinsically interlinked.</p>

                <h2>Block 1 Test</h2>
                <p>In the Block 1 test, I had grasped the concept of HSD better. This was because I had seen realistic questions on the work that I needed to know instead of the difficult tutorial questions that we never got answers to. The last question in the test aksed us to use a CLD to represent how apetite is inhibited in the body. This demonstrated how I could use HSD in my ISMS Biology course by making feedback mechanisms (e.g. in the endocrine system) easier to comprehend and study.</p>
